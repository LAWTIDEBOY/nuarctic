New Version: 30.11.2022
Temperature and salinity are now clean and calibrated. Please use and report
anything strange you might find. 
Quality flags are used according to paragraph 6. Quality flags from

es_V2_%28May_2010%29.pdf [www.seadatanet.org]
 
Oxygen is partly cleaned and calibrated. 
Still wrong are oxygen data from Leg2 and Leg3 from Ocean City. Both oxygen
sensors were broken for some profiles and we still try to get some usable
data out of it. 
Quality flags should be correct anyhow. Please use and report anything
strange you might find. 

Device Operation IDs including nans are those where the operation was not
logged in D-Ship and thus have no Device Operation ID. Those stations will
get new IDs when we report them to Pangaea. The nans will be filled with
numbers at some point, the 99 will remain. 
Once we have the new IDs, I will re-export the data to include the new IDs.
